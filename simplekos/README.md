# Simple KeyObjectStore (KOS)

This library is aimed to provide an easy solution to save objects to the storage. Each store is a directory with files for each key inside. A key is the reference to a specific saved item.

The library uses [Ason](https://github.com/afollestad/ason) to serialize and deserialize objects. Please check the documentation to learn how to annotate classes for serialization.

It is developed in Kotlin. Java interoperability isn't tested.
